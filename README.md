## The files in this repository represents prototype of the project idea presented by Team UnavAIlable.   
The files contain code that generates a text from audio and then converts it into a video. User's audio after converting to the video, will be shown to him for modifications. The video will then be sent to the counselor who can provide reply in their language of convenience. This message from the counselor will be translated back to the original language in which the user gave input. The user is going to receive a video with the response from the counselor.
